## CMATW
[Journey](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/) is a video game made by [ThatGameCompany](https://thatgamecompany.com/).

In this game, during your adventure, you are matched with players from around the world without knowing who they are.

You cannot communicate via speech or text as there is only what is called a [Chirp](https://journey.fandom.com/wiki/Chirp), but the adventure is a shared experience and you can often grow fond of your partner(s).

At the end of the game, a screen appears that reveals the names of everyone you have met during your adventure. This screen is called "Companions Met Along The Way" or CMATW for short.

This project aims to give you the ability to look up the names of companions you have met, in a manner similar to what the game does. It currently works with the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey) version only.

This is how the project looks:

To understand what the "SAVE.BIN" you are asked to drop is, please take a look at [The Journey Wiki](https://journey.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:_PC_version_-_Companions_Met_Along_the_Way_Problems).

## Save editor

Recently, a new functionality was added that has been around in the Journey community for a while in the form of an [Executable](https://github.com/zackmichaels5/Journey-Save-Editor).

But now it is also available [online](https://www.coldknife2.ninja/Journey/journeyEditor.html)!

With this editor, you are able to choose multiple parameters concerning your Journey save, such as scarf length, symbol used, robe color and selected level.
