## CMATW
[Journey](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/) is a video game made by ThatGameCompany

In this game, during your adventure, you are matched with gamers from around the world, without knowing who they are.

You can barely communicate with speech or text, but the adventure is shared, and you can often grow found of your partner.

At the end of the game, a screen appears to reveal the names of the people you've met during the adventure, this screen is called "Companions met along the way" or cmatw screen

This project first aims to be able to display the names of the companions you've met, in a manner similar to what the game does. It works with the [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey) version of the game

Here's a visual render of this project:

## Save editor

We recently added a new functionnality which has been around in the Journey community for a while in a Unity format. 

But now it's on the web with the web format !

It's the save editor.

With this editor, players will be able to choose a few parameters concerning their Journey saves, such as Scarf Length, Symbol used, Robe color, and level selection.
